module: oneview_unmanaged_device
short_description: Manage OneView Unmanaged Device resources.
description:
    - Provides an interface to manage Unmanaged Device resources. Can create, update, or delete.
version_added: "2.3"
requirements:
    - "python >= 2.7.9"
    - "hpOneView >= 3.1.0"
author: "Bruno Souza (@bsouza)"
options:
    state:
        description:
            - Indicates the desired state for the Unmanaged Device resource.
              C(present) will ensure data properties are compliant with OneView.
              C(absent) will remove the resource from OneView, if it exists.
        choices: ['present', 'absent']
    data:
        description:
            - List with Unmanaged Device properties.
        required: true
notes:
    - "To rename an Unmanaged Device you must inform a C(newName) in the data argument. The rename is non-idempotent"
